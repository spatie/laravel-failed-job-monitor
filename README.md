## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-failed-job-monitor
```

Next up, the service provider must be registered:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\FailedJobMonitor\FailedJobMonitorServiceProvider::class,
    ...
];
```

Next, you must publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\FailedJobMonitor\FailedJobMonitorServiceProvider"
```

This is the contents of the default configuration file.  Here you can specify the notifiable to which the notifications should be sent. The default notifiable will use the variables specified in this config file.

```php
return [

     'notification' => \Spatie\FailedJobMonitor\Notification::class,
     'channels'   => ['mail', 'slack'],
     'routes'     => [
         'mail' => [
             'to' => 'email@example.com',
         ],
 
         'slack' => [
             'webhook_url' => '',
             'channel' => '#failed-jobs',
             'username' => 'Failed Job Bot',
             'icon' => ':robot_face:',
         ],
     ],
];

``` 

## Configuration

### Customizing the notifiable
 
By default the package uses this notifiable class: `\Spatie\FailedJobMonitor\Notifiable`. If you use a channel that needs some get some extra information out of the notifiable you can easily extend the default notifiable.
Don't forget to register the notifiable in the config file like:
```php
// config/laravel-failed-job-monitor.php
return [
    'notifiable' => \App\CustomNotifiableForFailedJobMonitor::class,
    ...
```


### Customizing the notification
 
By default the package uses this notification class: `\Spatie\FailedJobMonitor\Notification`. If you use new channels or want to customize standard messages you can define your own Notification class that extend the default Notification class
Don't forget to register the notifiable in the config file:
```php
// config/laravel-failed-job-monitor.php
return [
    ...
    'notification' => \App\Notifications\CustomNotificationForFailedJobMonitor::class,
    ...
```
