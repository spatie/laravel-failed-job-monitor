This package sends notifications if a queued job fails. Out of the box it can send a notification via mail and/or Slack. It leverages Laravel's native notification system.

Spatie is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-failed-job-monitor
```
If you intend to use Slack notifications you should also install the guzzle client:

``` bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```

The service provider will automatically be registered.

Next, you must publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\FailedJobMonitor\FailedJobMonitorServiceProvider"
```

This is the contents of the default configuration file.  Here you can specify the notifiable to which the notifications should be sent. The default notifiable will use the variables specified in this config file.

```php
return [

    /**
     * The notification that will be sent when a job fails.
     */
    'notification' => \Spatie\FailedJobMonitor\Notification::class,

    /**
     * The notifiable to which the notification will be sent. The default
     * notifiable will use the mail and slack configuration specified
     * in this config file.
     */
    'notifiable' => \Spatie\FailedJobMonitor\Notifiable::class,

    /**
     * The channels to which the notification will be sent.
     */
    'channels' => ['mail', 'slack'],

    'mail' => [
        'to' => 'email@example.com',
    ],

    'slack' => [
        'webhook_url' => env('FAILED_JOB_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL'),
